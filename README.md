The board will be powered by a DIY battery pack made of 18650 cells. The wheel itself will be a Onewheel XR motor purchased used and driven by a Flipsky Mini FSESC6.7 Pro running VESC. The frame is made from 1"x2" aluminum stock. There are 1/8" aluminum plates under the tubes for support and mounting electronics, and 0.5" wood on top for the footplates. The bumpers and footplates will be made from TPU to absorb shocks and provide cushion. Everything (Except for the motor) is secured via an assortment of #10 bolts, nuts, and heatset inserts. The battery will sit in the front compartment of the board, and all of the other electronics including the charging port and power button will be in the back compartment. Theres also LED strips on the front and back for lighting. This project was inspired by byte sized engineering's DIY onewheel. In terms of experience, I have CADded robots for my FRC team, but I have never made any personal projects yet.
